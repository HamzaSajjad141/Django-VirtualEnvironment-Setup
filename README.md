# Django Virtual Environment Setup

This guide provides instructions on how to set up a virtual environment for your Django project. A virtual environment helps you manage project-specific dependencies and ensures a clean and organized development environment.

## What is a Virtual Environment?

A virtual environment is an isolated workspace that allows you to work on a specific project with its own set of Python libraries and dependencies. This isolation prevents conflicts between packages and makes managing dependencies easier.

## Why Use a Virtual Environment?

Using a virtual environment offers several advantages:

- **Dependency Isolation:** Each project can have its own set of dependencies without conflicts.
- **Clean Development Environment:** System-wide Python installations remain unaffected.
- **Version Management:** Easily manage different package versions for different projects.
- **Shareability:** Share your project with others by sharing the requirements file.
- **Easy Cleanup:** Delete a project's virtual environment when done.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` module:

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment on Windows:

This is how it looks when it activate

### 3. Install Django and Project Dependencies 

With the virtual environment active, install Django and any other project dependencies using pip:

### 4. Create a Django Project

To create a new Django project, run the following command:

![d1](https://github.com/HamzaSajjad141/Django-VirtualEnvironment-Setup/assets/125465047/7195aa30-7453-43f7-9f8b-15d936f8a625)

instead myproject you can name anything for your project name 

### 5. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory:

This is how myproject directory looks like:

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server using the following command:

![d55](https://github.com/HamzaSajjad141/Django-VirtualEnvironment-Setup/assets/125465047/42672bda-b389-4afb-86a1-77475456cc32)

You should see output indicating that the development server is running. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to see your Django project in action.

### 6. Start Working on Your Django Project

You're now ready to work on your Django project within the virtual environment. When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:

## Usage

- To activate the virtual environment: follow step 2 above.
- To deactivate the virtual environment: use the deactivate command.
